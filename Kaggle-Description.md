### Context

With the arrival of the COVID19 virus in New Zealand, the ministry of health is tracking new cases and releasing daily updates on the situation on their webpage: https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-cases. Much of the information given in these updates are not in a data science-friendly format. The objective of this dataset is to provide a friendly format for this data so that people can easily begin analysing the data.


### Content

All data in this dataset has been acquired from the New Zealand Minstry of Health's 'COVID19 current cases' webpage, located here: https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-cases. The Ministry of Health updates their page daily, that will be the targeted update frequency for this dataset too.

- The spread of the virus is logistic. Can we predict where the inflection point will be?
