### Context

With the arrival of the COVID19 virus in New Zealand, the ministry of health is tracking new cases and releasing daily updates on the situation on their webpage: https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-cases and
https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-cases/covid-19-current-cases-details. Much of the information given in these updates are not in a machine-friendly format. The objective of this dataset is to provide NZ Minstry of
Health COVID19 data in easy-to-use format.

### Content

All data in this dataset has been acquired from the New Zealand Minstry of Health's 'COVID19 current cases' webpage, located here: https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-cases. The Ministry of Health updates their page daily, that will be the targeted update frequency for this dataset for the `Daily Count of Cases` dataset. The `Case Details` dataset which
includes travel details on each case will be updated weekly.

### Limitations of this dataset

The mission of this project is to reliably convey data that the Ministry of Health has reported in the most digestable format. Enrichment of data is currently out of scope.

### Help improve this dataset

If you find any discrepancies between the Ministry of Health's data and this dataset, please provide your feedback as an issue on the git repo for this dataset: https://github.com/2kruman/COVID19-NZ-known-cases/issues.
