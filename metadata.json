Much of the information given in these updates are not in a data science-friendly format. The objective of this dataset is to provide a friendly format for this data so that people can easily begin analysing the data.\n\n\n### Content\n\nAll data in this dataset has been acquired from the New Zealand Minstry of Health's 'COVID19 current cases' webpage, located here: https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-cases. The Ministry of Health updates their page daily, that will be the targeted update frequency for this dataset too.\n\nContent:\n\n\n### Help improve this dataset\n\nIf you find any discrepancies between the Ministry of Health's data and this dataset, please provide your feedback as an issue on the git repo for this dataset: https://github.com/2kruman/COVID19-NZ-known-cases/issues.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nMajor questions that this data can help answer:\n- Where are the outbreaks happening?\n- Can the number of future infected be predicted?\n- The spread of the virus is logistic. Can we predict where the inflection point will be?",
